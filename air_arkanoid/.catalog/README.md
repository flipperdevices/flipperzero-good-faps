# Air Arkanoid

This is our simple version of the Arkanoid game that can use the motion-tracking sensor of the Video Game Module or Flipper Zero buttons to control the paddle. To play the game with buttons, disconnect the Video Game Module before running the game.

The Air Arkanoid game also demonstrates how to integrate the motion-tracking sensor of the Video Game Module into your game using the [Flipper Zero Game Engine](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-game-engine).
