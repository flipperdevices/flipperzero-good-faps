# USB Mass Storage emulator

This application allows you to use your Flipper Zero as a (very slow) USB mass storage device. You can create a disk image of up to 64MB, and then format and mount it on your computer via USB. All the images are stored on the SD card, which allows you to have multiple images and switch between them.
