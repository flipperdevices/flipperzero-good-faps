# Music Player

This is a simple music player that can play music using the Flipper Zero's speaker.

The music player supports the Flipper Music Format (FMF), which is similar to RTTL. You can find a sample song in the /apps_data/music_player folder on your SD card. It is a text file that you can open using any text editor on your computer. You can also find more songs on our [Community Forum](https://forum.flipper.net/t/music-player-songs/2715/35).

The volume can be adjusted using the UP and DOWN buttons on the D-pad.
